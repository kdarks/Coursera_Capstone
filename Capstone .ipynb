If a vineyard is told that a certain variable has more or less influence on the quality of the wine, they may be able to change those variables and increase their quality of wine, leading to more sales and more profit.

This dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine.\n\nThe data includes eleven variables that can be tested in the wine:1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulphates 11 - alcohol.  The data also includes a 12th column, which is Quality, a score between 0 and 10. The purpose of this report is to determine if the quality of a wine can be predicted based on the eleven qualities listed above. \n\nRelevant publication\nP. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T.
